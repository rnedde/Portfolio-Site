                <p class="short-description">Visitors are invited to send a message out to sea, and in return, receive a message left behind by a previous sender. </p>
                <p>What would you say if you didn’t know who was listening?</p>
<p>Murmurine invites you to cast your words into the unknown. In this interactive experience, visitors submit anonymous messages to a digital “sea.” In return, they receive a message sent by a past participant—printed out, ephemeral, and untraceable. Once shared, the message vanishes from the database, living on only as a fragile piece of paper.</p>
<p>Part storytelling, part ritual, the project explores what it means to share something vulnerable without knowing who will receive it, or when. There’s risk in this surrender: messages can’t be filtered, edited, or taken back. The exchange relies on trust, curiosity, and the quiet hope that what we send out into the world will find the right reader.</p>
<p>The experience lives in two forms: online and in a physical installation. In the gallery space, messages are printed from a bottle-shaped sculpture and delivered with the intimacy of a secret note. Visitors are invited to keep, share, or destroy the message they’ve received—an act of choice, reflection, or release.</p>
<p>Each message is a glimpse into a stranger’s inner world, bridging distances we can’t see. Through this exchange, Message in a Bottle becomes a meditation on anonymity, reciprocity, and the invisible threads that connect us.</p>
