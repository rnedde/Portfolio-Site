This website invites users to uncover if they experience time-space synesthesia, a phenomenon where time takes on spatial form in the mind’s eye.

 For those who do, the project provides a platform to visualize and share their unique perspectives of time. Through user submissions, the site displays a growing gallery of visualized time, highlighting the vast diversity—or surprising commonalities—between individuals’ mental maps of sequences like days, months, or years.
