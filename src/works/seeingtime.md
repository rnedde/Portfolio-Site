What does time look like to you? This interactive website invites users to uncover if they experience time-space synesthesia—a phenomenon where time takes on spatial form in the mind’s eye.

 For those who do, the project provides a platform to visualize and share their unique perspectives of time. Through user submissions, the site displays a growing gallery of visualized time, highlighting the vast diversity—or surprising commonalities—between individuals’ mental maps of sequences like days, months, or years. 
 
 The project also challenges the dominance of the Gregorian calendar by introducing alternative cultural views of time, encouraging users to question why we adhere to certain systems. Is it because they’re intuitive, efficient, or merely traditional? 
 
 As the first phase of a larger research initiative, Seeing Time seeks to collect and analyze these visualizations, asking whether patterns emerge or if each person’s relationship with time is entirely unique. By blending technology, art, and human insight, this project turns an abstract concept into something tangible, sparking curiosity about how we perceive and shape time in our minds—and what that says about us as individuals and as a society.
