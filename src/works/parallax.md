This interactive illustration tool brings a flat drawing to life by simulating depth through real-time face tracking. Built with p5.js and ml5.js, it maps the viewerâ€™s head movements to a series of layered images, each shifting at different speeds to create a parallax effect. As the viewer moves side to side, the scene subtly changes perspective, inviting them into a space that responds to their physical presence.
