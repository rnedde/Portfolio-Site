This interactive illustration tool brings a flat drawing to life by simulating depth through real-time face tracking. Built with p5.js and ml5.js, it maps the viewer’s head movements to a series of layered images, each shifting at different speeds to create a parallax effect. As the viewer moves side to side, the scene subtly changes perspective, inviting them into a space that responds to their physical presence.

The illusion is created entirely in 2D, using layering, math, and motion to create an illusion of depth. The effect is similar to early animation techniques developed by artists like Lotte Reiniger and Ub Iwerks, where background and foreground elements moved independently to create cinematic depth.

This project was partly inspired by Salvador Dalí’s Little Theater, a physical diorama that tricks the eye into seeing dimensionality through a peephole. Similarly, this browser-based version invites viewers to enter an illustrated world that shifts with them, transforming passive viewing into an embodied experience. It reimagines how illustration can behave, not just as something to look at, but something to look through.
