 Using recycled Ethernet cables as both material and metaphor, the project draws parallels between knitting communities and decentralized networks like underground mycelium systems. By inviting physical participation, Knitworks challenges anthropocentric ideas of intelligence and communication, transforming discarded technologies into a living, luminous network of shared signals. Through iterative prototyping, the work bridges analog craft and digital logic to reveal unexpected connections.
