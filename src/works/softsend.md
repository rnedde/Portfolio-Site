This material juxtaposition suggests an alternative experience of the climbing interaction, disrupting the ruggedness and utilitarian expectations associated with the hold. The soft texture introduces a moment of curiosity and hesitation, inviting the climber to pause and reconsider their relationship to the objectâ€”not simply as a point of leverage, but as a site of care, vulnerability, and touch.
