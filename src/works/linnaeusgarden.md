Inspired by Carl Linnaeus's 18th-century Flower Clock, this extension transforms your browser into a dynamic botanical timepiece. Linnaeus observed that different flowers open and close at specific times of the day, creating a natural way to tell time.

With this google chrome extension, you can watch flowers bloom and close in real-time based on the current hour. Adjust the time manually using arrow keys or buttons to see how the floral display changes throughout the day. After 10 seconds, the clock resets to the present time, keeping the experience in sync with nature.
