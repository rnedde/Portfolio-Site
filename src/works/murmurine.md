What would you say if you didn’t know who was listening?

Visitors submit anonymous messages to a digital “sea.” In return, they receive a message sent by a past participant. Once shared, the message vanishes from the database. There’s risk in this surrender: messages can’t be filtered, edited, or taken back. The exchange relies on trust, curiosity, and the quiet hope that what we send out into the world will find the right reader.
