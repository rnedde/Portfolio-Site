*Carmen Carcass* is a free, interactive digital museum (open 24 hours!) that explores the inner workings of the human body. Guided by an absent-minded brain with a flair for anatomical puns and mild chaos, you'll journey through a series of rooms filled with rich, hand-drawn animated illustrations. Each space peels back a layer of anatomy with curiosity, humor, and a healthy dose of disorder.
This institution first opened its digital doors in 2022.
