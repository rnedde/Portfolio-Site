This interactive web application is designed to help users explore stretches for various muscle groups through a playful, illustrated character named Bendi. By clicking on different parts of Bendiâ€™s body, users are shown a targeted stretch along with instructions and a countdown timer. The SVG-based design enables precise interactivity, while CSS variables and JavaScript bring each region to life with dynamic color changes. Though only the front side is currently implemented, future additions could include back-body muscles, animations, and illustrations for each stretch. Designed for beginners and mobility enthusiasts alike, the tool turns anatomical exploration into a friendly, engaging experience.
