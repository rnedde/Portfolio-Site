For a week I decided to freely crochet a different object every day as I rode the New York City subway. I started a new object every time I paid a fare and entered the subway system, and tied off the end when I left. The color of embroidery thread I used corresponded to the color of train I was on at the time. I am selling them for $2.90 each, the price of a fare. Naturally.
