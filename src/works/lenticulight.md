Is there a reason this hasn’t been done before?

Lenticulight adapts a simple craft usually created with folded paper and printed imagery, but using LEDs, I have added the element of time. I wanted to push the boundaries of time based art to another dimension, so I imagined this piece where the position of the viewer impacts the way they experience it. Each angle, each movement, and each step from the viewer creates a different effect, making one’s spatial relation to the piece just as important as the piece itself.
